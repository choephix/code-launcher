# Environment Variables for Code Launcher
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to '.env' in the same directory.
# 2. Set the value of CODELAUNCHER_WORKSPACE_PATH to the absolute path of your workspace.
#
# Example:
# CODELAUNCHER_WORKSPACE_PATH=/home/user/projects
#

# CODELAUNCHER_WORKSPACE_PATH
# This variable specifies the root directory where your projects are located.
#
# Notes:
# - This path is used by the application to scan for and list your projects.
# - Ensure the path exists and the application has read access to it.
# - Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows systems.
# - Do not include quotation marks around the path.
# - The path should be absolute (start from the root of your file system).
#
# Important:
# - Keep your actual .env file out of version control (add it to .gitignore).
# - Update this example file when adding new environment variables to the project.
#
# After setting up:
# - You can access this value in the Next.js application using:
#   process.env.CODELAUNCHER_WORKSPACE_PATH

CODELAUNCHER_WORKSPACE_PATH=/workspaces
