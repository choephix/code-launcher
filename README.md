### It's a mess

/apps

* Client with Vite - ❌ (boilerplate still)
* Server with Elysia - ✅ (though unused at the moment)
* Server with Fastify - ❌ (can't unbreak)
* Both with NextJS - ✅ ***Default for now***

/packages

* /react-components - TODO
* /shell-operations - used internally by api routes on nextjs and elysia
